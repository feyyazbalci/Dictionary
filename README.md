The web api side of this project was developed using Onion Architecture. On the web app side, Blazor technology was used. In the Authentication part, the JWT Token system was used. Instant entry likes of the user were sent to the system with RabbitMQ. Again, on the webapi side, the Mediator design pattern was used, which allows you to manage the complex network of relations between various objects within a single mediator object.
